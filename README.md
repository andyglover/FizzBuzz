# FizzBuzz
Using my very fresh Javascript skills to solve FizzBuzz, a common programming challenge.

- This was a good refresher on pushing a project with HTML, CSS and javascript to github

- This was my first time embedding a .js file, and using a for loop and if/else statements.

- I'd encountered FizzBuzz before, but never successfully solved it on my own, so, woohoo!

## :cup_with_straw: :bee:

The rules of FizzBuzz are:

- Print numbers from 1 to 100

- If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".

- If the number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz".

- If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

- Otherwise, print the number.
